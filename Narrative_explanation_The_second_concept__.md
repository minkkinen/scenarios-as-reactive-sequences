### Narrative explanation

The second concept from historical social science is narrative explanation, which is closely related to historical thinking. Of course, narrative is widely present in scenario thinking and for futures research in general. \citet[39]{schwartz1996art} defines scenarios as "stories that give meaning to events". Scenarios usually contain a scenario narrative, understood as the fleshing-out of the scenario variables \citep[e.g.]{Heinonen_2013}. Narrative is also a central aspect of causal layered analysis, especially on the myth/metaphor layer where futures are articulated as stories \citep{inayatullah1998causal}. Similarly, \citet{MacDonald_2012} argues that there may be archetypal cultural narratives underlying scenarios.

However, within the futures field, narratives are often considered in the literary sense, as products of creative writing \citep[e.g.]{Burnam_Fink_2014}. Likewise, historians may consider their task as weaving literary narratives, and thus their primary interest is in literary representations of events rather than events as such \citep{staley2007history}.

In contrast, I will focus on narrative *explanation* here, which means a more systematic social scientific approach to narrative than the literary understanding of the term. This concept brings narrative closer to scientific realism. As \citet{Abell_2004} puts it, "social reality can metaphysically be pictured as an evolutionary network of complex social interactions (i.e., as a narrative)". Is a way, social reality *is* a narrative.

Some social scientists have argued for narrative explanation as an alternative to variable-based explanations \citep{Abell_2004}. 



- analytic narratives: theoretically structured stories about coherent sequences of motivated actions \citep[][458]{Aminzade_1992}
  - can contribute to the construction of explanations of why things happened the way they did
  - narratives construct causality and meaning in terms of temporal connections among events \citep{Aminzade_1992}

Narrative explanation: chain of linked events leading to a conclusion that is not predictable \citep[][289]{Abell_2004}.

Also \cite{greycite30256}

\citet{Abbott_1992} writes about *enchainment* rather than causality

Singular causality: transformative power of human actions. Narrative explanation only works with human action (Abell)?

Graph: what are the nodes and edges? nodes = conditions, states of the world (events?); edges = enchainment, causal mechanisms (or events?)

A further question is which are the most important events, the crucial nodes in the sequence. The social world is full of events, and it is often difficult discerning which ones are relevant for the research at hand. Historical institutionalists use the term *critical junctures* to refer to such crucial events \citep{Capoccia_2007}. These are critical choice points which radically alter the direction of a process. To some extent, they could be likened to black swans or wild cards within futures research, but perhaps they need not be as dramatic. In reality, it is usually difficult to identify clear critical junctures, and therefore it may be more suitable to consider criticality of events as a continuum. \citet{mahoney2000path} makes the point that critical events are contingent, that is, they cannot be predicted with existing theory. My hypothesis is that substantive theory of the topic is needed for identifying crucial events.

The goal of narrative explanation or analytic narratives is generalisation of sequence types. History certainly does not repeat itself, but it is plausible that similar types of processes may occur at different times and in different places, if the conditions are sufficiently similar. They may even take the form of "robust processes" that occur in similar ways across a wide spectrum of time and place \citep{Aminzade_1992}. The metaphor of a musical sequence, where a melodic pattern is repeated at different pitches, is apt here.
