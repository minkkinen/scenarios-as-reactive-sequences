# Scenario framework

How can these insights be applied to scenario building? Two aspects of scenario content are particularly important:

1. the distinction between snapshot and sequence scenarios and
2. the distinction between external and strategic scenarios.

Considering the first distinction, in this paper scenarios are considered as sequences of events or paths of development rather than end-points. This is by no means the only way of considering scenarios. Scenarios are often conceived as structural descriptions of a future environment, and as such they may be highly useful for planning an organisation's activities \cite{schwartz1996art}. \citet[77--78]{staley2007history} explicitly states that a "scenario is meant to be synchronic rather than diachronic", describing "the rules of a game, rather than a description of the specific sequence of play".
