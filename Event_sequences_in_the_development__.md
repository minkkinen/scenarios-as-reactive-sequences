# Event sequences in the development of privacy protection

To illustrate this scenario approach, I will use an example from my own substantial focus area which is privacy and more specifically privacy protection. I am particularly interested in the development of privacy protection instruments, understood as various legal, technological and other instruments to protect a desired level of privacy \cite{bennett2006governance}.

The tentative framework developed above can be applied to the development of privacy protection. This means seeking event sequences in privacy protection which may be extended into alternative future scenarios.

Process of renewing EU data protection directive -> Snowden revelations ->

Coming together of security interests, commercial interests, digital rights etc.
