# Event sequences in the development of privacy protection

My own substantial focus area is privacy and more specifically privacy protection, understood as various legal, technological and other instruments to protect a desired level of privacy \cite{bennett2006governance}.

The tentative framework developed above can be applied to the development of privacy protection. This means seeking event sequences in privacy protection which may be extended into alternative future scenarios.

Process of renewing EU data protection directive -> Snowden revelations ->

Coming together of security interests, commercial interests, digital rights etc.
