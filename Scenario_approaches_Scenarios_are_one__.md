## Scenario approaches

Scenarios are one of the central tools of futures research. According to \citet[][317]{bell1997foundations}, scenarios are used by all futurists in some form and scenarios are the end product of all futures research methods. Despite the wide spread of scenario methods, or perhaps because of it, there is no consensus on what scenarios are and how they ought to be created.  Several recent articles have divided scenario approaches into scenario types \citep{Bishop_2007,Bradfield_2005, B_rjeson_2006, van_Notten_2003}. These typologies are based on different criteria. For example, \citet{B_rjeson_2006} focus on purposes and aims, while \citet{Bishop_2007} focus on scenario techniques, and \citet{van_Notten_2003} ambitiously consider project goal, process design and scenario content. \citet{Bradfield_2005}, in turn, focus on three historical schools of scenario development.

In this paper, I will focus on what \citet{van_Notten_2003} call scenario content: the characteristics of the actual scenarios rathe than the practical aims of the exercise, the process design or the organisational surroundings. More specifically, I am interested in the theoretical and social scientific basis of the scenario content and the claims that are made within scenarios. This means the philosophy of science questions that are implied in specific forms of scenario content.
