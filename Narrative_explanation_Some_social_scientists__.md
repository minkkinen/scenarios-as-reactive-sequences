# Narrative explanation

Some social scientists have argued for narrative explanation as an alternative to variable explanations \cite{Abell_2004}. Scenarios usually contain a scenario narrative, understood as the fleshing-out of the scenario variables \cite[e.g.]{Heinonen_2013}.

The issue of narrative has been extensively discussed within futures research. For instance, \citet{MacDonald_2012} argues that there may be archetypal cultural narratives underlying scenarios, in this way continuing Dator's work.

However, here the focus is on narrative *explanation*, which means a more systematic social scientific approach to narrative than the common understanding of the term. Indeed, often narrative is understood as an alternative to rigorous social scientific explanation.

Narrative explanation: chain of linked events leading to a conclusion that is not predictable \cite[][289]{Abell_2004}.

Singular causality: transformative power of human actions

- "Historical narrative offers an especially useful method for making sense of the multiple steps in a reactive sequence. Through a narrative account, the analyst can provide ''a scene by scene description of the particular causal paths" through which an initial breakpoint leads to a final outcome. Furthermore, the step-by-step approach of narrative allows the analyst to use counterfactual methods in exploring specific causal links in the overall chain." (p. 530) \cite{mahoney2000path}
- "The events that make up a reactive sequence are connected by tight causal linkages, or what Griffin and Ragin call ''inherent sequentiality."^82 The basic idea underlying inherent sequentiality is Abbott's notion that an ''inherent logic of events" characterizes enchained sequences." (p. 530) \cite{mahoney2000path}
