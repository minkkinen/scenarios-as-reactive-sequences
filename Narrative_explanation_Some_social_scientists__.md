# Narrative explanation

Some social scientists have argued for narrative explanation as an alternative to variable explanations \cite{Abell_2004}. Scenarios usually contain a scenario narrative, understood as the fleshing-out of the scenario variables \cite[e.g.]{Heinonen_2013}.

The issue of narrative has been extensively discussed within futures research. For instance, \citet{MacDonald_2012} argues that there may be archetypal cultural narratives underlying scenarios, in this way continuing Dator's work.

However, here the focus is on narrative *explanation*, which means a more systematic social scientific approach to narrative than the common understanding of the term. Indeed, often narrative is understood as an alternative to rigorous social scientific explanation.

Narrative explanation: chain of linked events leading to a conclusion that is not predictable \cite[][289]{Abell_2004}.
