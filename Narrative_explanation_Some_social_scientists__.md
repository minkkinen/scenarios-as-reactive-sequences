# Narrative explanation

Some social scientists have argued for narrative explanation as an alternative to variable explanations \citep{Abell_2004}. Scenarios usually contain a scenario narrative, understood as the fleshing-out of the scenario variables \citep[e.g.]{Heinonen_2013}.

The issue of narrative has been extensively discussed within futures research. For instance, \citet{MacDonald_2012} argues that there may be archetypal cultural narratives underlying scenarios, in this way continuing Dator's work.

However, here the focus is on narrative *explanation*, which means a more systematic social scientific approach to narrative than the common understanding of the term. Indeed, often narrative is understood as an alternative to rigorous social scientific explanation.

- analytic narratives: theoretically structured stories about coherent sequences of motivated actions \citep{Aminzade_1992}
  - can contribute to the construction of explanations of why things happened the way they did
  - narratives construct causality and meaning in terms of temporal connections among events \citep{Aminzade_1992}

Narrative explanation: chain of linked events leading to a conclusion that is not predictable \citep[][289]{Abell_2004}.

\citet{Abbott_1992} writes about *enchainment* rather than causality

Singular causality: transformative power of human actions. Narrative explanation only works with human action (Abell)?

Graph: what are the nodes and edges? nodes = conditions, states of the world (events?); edges = enchainment, causal mechanisms (or events?)

A further question is which are the most important events, the crucial nodes in the sequence. The social world is full of events, and it is often difficult discerning which ones are relevant for the research at hand. Historical institutionalists use the term *critical junctures* to refer to such crucial events \citep{Capoccia_2007}. These are critical choice points which radically alter the direction of a process. To some extent, they could be likened to black swans or wild cards within futures research, but perhaps they need not be as dramatic. In reality, it is usually difficult to identify clear critical junctures, and therefore it may be more suitable to consider criticality of events as a continuum. \citet{mahoney2000path} makes the point that critical events are contingent, that is, they cannot be predicted with existing theory. My hypothesis is that substantive theory of the topic is needed for identifying crucial events.

The goal of narrative explanation or analytic narratives is generalisation of sequence types. History certainly does not repeat itself, but it is plausible that similar types of processes may occur at different times and in different places, if the conditions are sufficiently similar. They may even take the form of "robust processes" that occur in similar ways across a wide spectrum of time and place \citep{Aminzade_1992}. The metaphor of a musical sequence, where a melodic pattern is repeated at different pitches, is apt here.
