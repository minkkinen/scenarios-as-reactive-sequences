# Introduction

Scenarios are one of the most widely used methods in futures research, and there is a wide variety of scenario methods, as documented by \citet{Bishop_2007}, for example. Scenarios are commonly used in practically oriented foresight work as structural descriptions of the future which help to anticipate possible future circumstances. In this context, the focus is on the impacts of trends, variables and macro-level drivers.

In an introduction to a recent special issue of *Futures*, Mermet et al. call for critical discussion of the theoretical bases of futures work, drawing on both work within the futures field and in  other academic fields \citep{Mermet_2009}. This conceptual paper contributes to this goal by discussing how concepts from historical social sciences could enrich the theoretical basis of scenario building.

In contrast, this paper examines scenarios as tools to anticipate possible social change processes from an event-based perspective. The starting point of the paper is the parallel between futures studies and historical social science as fields which study change over time. The central question then is which concepts and approaches futures researchers could usefully employ from historical social science. A tentative a scenario framework is presented which incorporates these insights from historically oriented social science.

The problem with traditional causal explanations is that variables act rather than actors, and thus stories disappear \citep{Abbott_1992}.
