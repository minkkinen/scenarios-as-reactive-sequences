# Introduction

Scenarios are one of the most widely used methods in futures research, and there is a wide variety of scenario methods, as documented by \citet{Bishop_2007}, for example. Scenarios are commonly used in planning as structural descriptions of the future which help to anticipate possible future circumstances. In this context, the focus is on the impacts of trends, variables and macro-level drivers.

In contrast, this paper examines scenarios as tools to anticipate possible social change processes from an event-based perspective. The paper presents a scenario framework which incorporates insights from historically oriented social science.

The problem with traditional causal explanations is that variables act rather than actors, and thus stories disappear \cite{Abbott_1992}.
