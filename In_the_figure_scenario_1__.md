In the figure, scenario 1 begins with future event F and scenario 2 begins with future event C.
In addition, the second scenario includes the influence of the external sequence E which impacts the event D, making this point a conjuncture.
In the RTBF example, we can hypothesise about the possible decisions that Google may take, given the public pressure and the recommendations of the Advisory Council.
Depending on which decision is taken, other key actors such as EU legislators may react in different ways.
Alternatively, civil society actors may take a more proactive role or a new individual may start a legal proceeding which directs the process.
In any case, the order in which events occur plays a significant role.

Scenarios, understood in this way, are explicitly event and sequence-oriented, outlining possible future event sequences, branching points and conjunctures.
Of course, the difficulty is that the future may branch indefinitely.
The question then becomes which futures are different in relevant ways, abstracting away contextual details.
This requires active interpretation from the researcher.
