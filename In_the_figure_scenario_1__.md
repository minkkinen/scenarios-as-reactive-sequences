In the figure, scenario 1 begins with future event F and scenario 2 begins with future event C.
In addition, the second scenario includes the influence of the external sequence E which impacts the event D, making this point a conjuncture.
In the RTBF example, we can hypothesise about the possible decisions that Google may take, given the public pressure and the recommendations of the Advisory Council.
Depending on which decision is taken, other key actors such as EU legislators may react in different ways.
Alternatively, civil society actors may take a more proactive role or a new individual may start a legal proceeding which directs the process.
In any case, the order in which events occur plays a significant role.

Scenarios, understood in this way, are explicitly event and sequence-oriented, outlining possible future event sequences, branching points and conjunctures.
Of course, the difficulty is that the future may branch indefinitely.
The question then becomes which decisions or possible events lead to futures that are different in relevant ways, abstracting away contextual details.
This is similar to the notion of critical uncertainties in the GBN method of scenario building, although the focus here is on actors rather than variables \citep{schwartz1996art}.
Uncovering these essential decisions requires active interpretation from the researcher.

Once such key decisions and events have been formulated, how to figure out which of these decisions actors will take?
For this, I would argue that understanding of the structural context is needed.
That is, the futures researcher needs to consider the latent structural possibilities, dispositions, affordances and so on which were referred to above.
This understanding of the structural context is crucial because while actors are free to choose which actions to take, they make these choices within the limits of the circumstances.
