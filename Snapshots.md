## Sequences and snapshots

Two aspects of scenario content are particularly important:

1. the distinction between snapshot and sequence scenarios and
2. the distinction between external and strategic scenarios.

Considering the first distinction, in this paper scenarios are considered as sequences of events or paths of development rather than end-points. This is by no means the only way of considering scenarios. Scenarios are often conceived as structural descriptions of a future environment, and as such they may be highly useful for planning an organisation's activities \cite{schwartz1996art}. \citet[][77--78]{staley2007history} explicitly states that a "scenario is meant to be synchronic rather than diachronic", describing "the rules of a game, rather than [...] the specific sequence of play". In other words, a scenario is conceived as a thick structural description of a future end-state.

The interesting thing is that \citet[][77]{staley2007history} states that discovering a pattern in events is impossible, and thus researchers need to capture the larger structure that emerges from these events. In a way, my approach is exactly opposite to this. We cannot predict events, but we can make conditional forecasts about *types of events*. According to mechanism-based and sequence-based approaches, researchers cannot predict outcomes without breaking the explanation down into smaller bits and explaining the links between these.

According to \citet{Bishop_2007}, the Global Business Network or Shell method of building scenarios has become dominant and it has somewhat shadowed other scenario techniques. Of course, the success of the GBN technique is partly due to the fact that it is an excellent, insightful technique, but partly it is a path-dependent and self-reinforcing development as new futurists are taught the GBN method or a variation of it and they may never get acquainted with alternative approaches. In my view, it is a richness rather than a hindrance that there are many different scenario approaches. The evolution of scenario building should not lead to one dominant approach but to a diversity of approaches.

In a way, this paper proposes a return to the roots of scenario building, since \citet{kahn1967year} argue that scenarios should consist of sequences of events.
