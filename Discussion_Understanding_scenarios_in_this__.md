# Discussion

Understanding scenarios in this way has significant implications for futures research because it highlights the importance of the timing and order of events within processes.

Nevertheless, the intention is not to predict future development paths, but to argue for possible sequences of events based on theoretical knowledge and knowledge of historical development.

As I mentioned earlier, the notion of scenarios as event sequences is nothing new. What, then, is the novelty value of this paper? The aim of this paper has been to systematically discuss the implications of understanding scenarios as event sequences, using concepts from historical social science.

Weaknesses of this approach?

- short time horizon
- still at an early stage: uncertainty of practical feasibility
- not suitable for all topics
