# Discussion

Understanding scenarios in this way has significant implications for futures research because it highlights the importance of the timing and order of events within processes.

Nevertheless, the intention is not to predict future development paths, but to argue for possible sequences of events based on theoretical knowledge and knowledge of historical development.

As I mentioned earlier, the notion of scenarios as event sequences is nothing new. What, then, is the novelty value of this paper? The aim of this paper has been to systematically discuss the implications of understanding scenarios as event sequences, using concepts from historical social science.

Weaknesses of this approach?

- short time horizon
- still at an early stage: uncertainty of practical feasibility
- not suitable for all topics

This approach leaves open the question of the right level of analysis. \citet{Abell_2004} acknowledges that narrative explanation is time-consuming and expensive, and often explanation based on statistical regularities is more appropriate. However, we should at least acknowledge that we should strive to open black boxes of narrative explanations within scenarios, if possible.

In addition, this approach has not considered actors' subjective understandings of time and of social processes. In order to fully understand historical sequences and potential future sequences, subjective temporal orientations would also need to be taken into account \citep{Aminzade_1992}.
