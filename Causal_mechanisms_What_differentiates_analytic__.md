### Causal mechanisms

What differentiates analytic narratives from literary narratives is that they are more explicit in explaining how events are linked to one another. Here, theorists use the term *causal mechanisms*. In order to understand linkages, the concept of causality needs to be briefly discussed. In positivist social science, causal explanations mean that certain empirically observable features appear together, for instance low educational level is associated with poverty. In the context of event sequences, causality means something slightly different. Causality in this case means that events are linked together by *causal mechanisms*.

There are various definitions of mechanisms but the general idea is usually the same: opening the 'black box' of causal explanation and explaining *how* certain phenomena bring about other phenomena \citep{Hedstr_m_2010}. In reactive sequences, this means having a theoretical explanation for the connections between the nodes in the event sequence. A process or a sequence of events is thus a chain of mechanisms.

Necessary and sufficient conditions (Mahoney)

\citet{Abbott_1992} writes about *enchainment* rather than causality. This means the link in a story from one step to the next.

Mechanism-based explanations make predicting outcomes problematic \citep{Hedstr_m_2010}.
Narrative explanation: chain of linked events leading to a conclusion that is not predictable \citep[][289]{Abell_2004}. This means that 

Singular causality: transformative power of human actions. Narrative explanation only works with human action (Abell)?

This is where the privacy protection example cannot be continued further, because understanding the mechanisms that are involved requires pruning the sequence to the most crucial events, finding which events are linked, and then examining each link critically to discover potential mechanisms.
This effort is clearly beyond the scope of this paper.
