## Causal mechanisms

What differentiates analytic narratives from literary narratives is that they are more explicit in explaining how events are linked to one another.
Here, historical social scientists use the term *causal mechanisms*.
In positivist social science, causal explanations mean that certain empirically observable features occur together, for instance low educational level is associated with poverty.
In the context of event sequences, causality means that events are linked together by *causal mechanisms*.
According to \citet[][291]{Abell_2004}, the notion of singular causality is appropriate for narrative explanation because it recognises the transformative power of human actions, both individual and collective.

There are various definitions of mechanisms but the general idea is usually the same: opening the 'black box' of causal explanation and explaining *how* certain phenomena bring about other phenomena \citep{Hedstr_m_2010}.
In reactive sequences, this means having a theoretical explanation for the connections between the nodes in the event sequence. Each step is either a necessary or sufficient condition for the next step \citep{mahoney2000path}.
\citet{Griffin_1993} suggests that causal interpretations are built "brick by brick" by repeatedly answering factual and counterfactual questions.
Causal mechanisms are the bricks or building blocks in this process of investigation.
A sequence of events is thus at the same time a sequence of causal mechanisms. Mechanisms are usually thought to be at least relatively general, and therefore they are crucial for generalising analytic narratives.

For scenario building, an important point is that mechanism-based explanations make predicting outcomes problematic.
Mechanisms allow explanation but not prediction, because we cannot know with certainty which mechanisms will be activated in a particular situation \citep{Hedstr_m_2010}.
Narrative explanation: chain of linked events leading to a conclusion that is not predictable \citep[][289]{Abell_2004}.
This means that scenario analysts need to consider the entire chain rather than jumping to the outcome (a structural description of the future).
Scenarios can also be built "brick by brick", based on scientific knowledge and expert judgment about the structural possibilities in a historical situation.

Interestingly, \citet[][77]{staley2007history} argues for structural rather than event-based scenarios, stating that discovering a pattern in events is impossible, and thus researchers need to capture the larger structure that emerges from events.
In a way, the argument in this paper is exactly the opposite.
We cannot predict events or outcomes, but we can make conditional forecasts about types of events and event sequences.

This is where the privacy protection example cannot be continued further, because understanding the mechanisms that are involved requires pruning the sequence to the most crucial events, finding which events are linked, and then examining each link critically to discover potential mechanisms.
This effort is clearly beyond the scope of this paper.
