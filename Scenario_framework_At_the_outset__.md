# Applying the concepts to scenario building

How do these three concepts enrich building sequence scenarios? At the outset, it is important to acknowledge that mechanism-based explanations make predicting outcomes problematic \citep{Hedstr_m_2010}.

If scenarios are understood as reactive sequences within the context of narrative explanation, what needs to be taken into account in building scenarios? In brief, building scenarios from this perspective contains three steps: 1) selecting theoretically relevant factors, 2) tracing historical change processes and finding critical events and 3) creating event-based scenarios.

The first preliminary step is getting acquainted with the substantive theory on the topic that is studied. The second step is tracing change processes within the identified theoretically relevant factors, with a focus on event sequences rather than time series of variables.

Finally, the scenarios themselves should be explicitly event and sequence-oriented, outlining possible future event sequences, branching points and conjunctures (see Fig. 2).
