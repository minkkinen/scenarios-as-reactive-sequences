## Historical social science and narrative explanation

The starting point for this paper is that scenario approaches need to be grounded in a solid social scientific basis, and the development of scenario techniques should follow developments in the social sciences.

In particular, historical social science provides a fruitful juxtaposition with scenario building. Of course, the argument has been made many times that history and futures research are parallel in their interest in time-bound phenomena \cite[e.g.]{Kaivo_oja_2004,staley2007history}, but this argument is rarely taken further, nor are recent developments in historical scholarship considered in depth.

The aim of this paper is to import some concepts from historical social science into the theoretical arsenal of futures research. Three concepts are central: *reactive sequences*, *causal mechanisms*, and *narrative explanation*. I am not claiming that these and similar concepts have not been used in futures research, but their implications for scenario thinking have rarely been systematically considered.

\citet{mahoney2000path} argues that there are two types of sequences that can be analysed using the framework of path dependence: self-reinforcing sequences and reactive sequences. Self-reinforcing sequences are perhaps the better known type, since the classic examples of path dependence (the VHS recorder and QWERTY keyboard layout) represent this type of sequence. In a self-reinforcing sequence, an initial choice becomes entrenched over time due to increasing returns and other mechanisms of reproduction.

Some scenarios may be represented as self-reinforcing sequences, as kind of "winner takes all" narratives. However, I would argue that the second type of sequence, reactive sequence, is more common and general, and therefore more useful for futures research. \citet[][526]{mahoney2000path} gives the following definition of a reactive sequence:

>  Reactive sequences are chains of temporally ordered and causally connected events. In a reactive sequence, each event in the sequence is both a reaction to antecedent events and a cause of subsequent events.

The definition is simple but it has wide implications. Because early events constrain subsequent ones, their impact cascades throughout the entire sequence. This is a similar notion to the notion in evolutionary futures studies that small changes in initial conditions may have drastic impacts on outcomes \cite{Mannermaa_1991}. However, here the focus is on events and actions rather than external conditions.

Another crucial implication is that the order and timing of events play a crucial role. Thus it is not only important to consider what is done (action) and by whom (actor), but also *when* this action is taken.

The title of this paper is *scenarios as reactive sequences*. The argument that I make is that scenarios can be fruitfully seen as reactive sequences of possible future developments.



Of course, narrative has been used in FS, but more social scientific notion: narrative *explanation*

Futurists are also accustomed to thinking in processual terms. We usually think in terms of different types of continuities (trends, megatrends) and discontinuities (weak signals, emerging issues, black swans). The focus on narrative and event sequences represents an attempt to enrich this thinking by breaking trends into their component parts: which events and actions constitute an empirical trend?

The difficulty with a processual or narrative approach is that events are part of several narratives at the same time, and connecting them into coherent stories involves much interpretation even if a realist perspective is adopted. Contemporary social scientists do not consider that there is a grand narrative such as progress or secularisation that encompasses all events and makes them understandable. Instead, narratives at different time horizons overlap and cross each other in complex ways. As \citet[][438]{Abbott_1992} states, "the full social process, when viewed in narrative terms, makes up a network of stories flowing into the present and future". Historical sociologists use the term *conjuncture* to represent the intersection of separate sequences \citep{mahoney2000path}.

"social reality can metaphysically be pictured as an evolutionary network of complex social interactions (i.e., as a narrative)" \citep{Abell_2004}

Perhaps the best solution is that narrative explanations make use of mid-level narratives that are neither lists of single events nor grand global stories. This means for instance studying a particular institution in a geographical area at some point in history. I will create a sketch of this kind of discussion in the section on privacy protection below.
