# Historical social science and narrative explanation

The starting point for this paper is that scenario approaches need to be grounded in a solid social scientific basis, and the development of scenario techniques should follow developments in the social sciences.

In particular, historical social science provides a fruitful juxtaposition with scenario building. Of course, the argument has been made many times that history and futures research are parallel in their interest in time-bound phenomena \cite[e.g.]{Kaivo_oja_2004,staley2007history}, but this argument is rarely taken further, nor are recent developments in historical scholarship considered in any depth.

\citet{mahoney2000path} argues that there are two types of sequences that can be analysed using the framework of path dependence: self-reinforcing sequences and reactive sequences. Self-reinforcing sequences are perhaps the better known type, since the classic examples of path dependence (the VHS recorder and QWERTY keyboard layout) represent this type of sequence. In a self-reinforcing sequence, an initial choice becomes entrenched over time due to increasing returns and other mechanisms of reproduction.

Some scenarios may be represented as self-reinforcing sequences, as kind of "winner takes all" narratives. However, I would argue that the second type of sequence, reactive sequence, is more common and general, and therefore more useful for futures research. \citet[][526]{mahoney2000path} gives the following definition of a reactive sequence:

>  Reactive sequences are chains of temporally ordered and causally connected events. In a reactive sequence, each event in the sequence is both a reaction to antecedent events and a cause of subsequent events.

The definition is simple but it has wide implications. Because early events constrain subsequent ones, their impact cascades throughout the entire sequence. This is a similar notion to the notion in evolutionary futures studies that small changes in initial conditions may have drastic impacts on outcomes \cite{Mannermaa_1991}. However, here the focus is on events and actions rather than external conditions.

Another crucial implication is that the order and timing of events play a crucial role. Thus it is not only important to consider what is done (action) and by whom (actor), but also *when* this action is taken.

The title of this paper is *scenarios as reactive sequences*. The argument that I make is that scenarios can be fruitfully seen as reactive sequences of possible future developments.

Mechanism-based explanations make predicting outcomes problematic \cite{Hedstr_m_2010}.

Of course, narrative has been used in FS, but more social scientific notion: narrative *explanation*
