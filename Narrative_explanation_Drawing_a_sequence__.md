## Narrative explanation

Drawing a sequence of linked events is not enough for building scenarios: events must be linked together by a narrative. Thus the second concept from historical social science is narrative explanation, which is closely related to historical thinking.
Of course, narrative is central to scenario thinking in general. \citet[][39]{schwartz1996art} defines scenarios as "stories that give meaning to events". Scenarios usually contain a scenario narrative, understood as the fleshing out of the scenario variables \citep{Heinonen_2013,schwartz1996art}.
Narrative is also a central aspect of causal layered analysis, especially on the myth/metaphor layer where futures are articulated as stories \citep{inayatullah1998causal}.
Similarly, \citet{MacDonald_2012} argues that there may be archetypal cultural narratives underlying scenarios.

However, within the futures field, narratives are often considered in the literary sense, as products of creative writing \citep{Burnam_Fink_2014}.
Likewise, some historians are primarily interested in literary and linguistic representations of events rather than explaining causes of events  \citep{staley2007history}.
Narratives are important, but they should be understood within the frame of narrative *explanation*, which is a social scientific attempt to link narrative to causal explanation and thus bring narrative closer to scientific realism.
\citet{Griffin_1993} states that a narrative explanation is "an unfording, open-ended story fraught with conjunctures and contingency, where what happens, an action, in fact happens because of its order and position in the story".
This definition highlights the key points about narrative explanation: conjunctures, contingency and temporal order.
As \citet{Abell_2004} puts it, "social reality can metaphysically be pictured as an evolutionary network of complex social interactions (i.e., as a narrative)".
In a way, social reality then *is* a narrative.
Narrative explanation can be understood as an alternative to variable-based explanations but without abandoning the notion of causality, although some theorists prefer to speak of *enchainment* rather than causality \citep{Abbott_1992,Abell_2004}.
The problem with traditional causal explanations in explaining human actions is that variables rather than actors seem to act and thus "stories disappear", that is, inherent connections among events are blurred \citep{Abbott_1992}.

Essentially, narrative explanation means linking events together with causal explanations.
The task of a social scientist is to build an analytic or causal narrative from a chain of events.
Analytic narratives are "theoretically structured stories about coherent sequences of motivated actions" \citep[][458]{Aminzade_1992}.
\citet{greycite30256}, in turn, defines a causal narrative as "an orderly analysis of the sequence of events and the causal processes that connected them, leading from a set of initial conditions to the outcome in question".
These definitions are very similar, and both forms aim to scientifically explain why certain events took place.
In the following, I will use the term analytic narrative.

The connection between narratives and reactive sequences is that narratives are representations of a sequence which include theorising about actors' motives and structural possibilities.
Narratives the story of a sequence of events in a theoretically informed way.
The difficult question is which are the most important events for the narrative.
The social world is full of events, and it is often difficult discerning which ones are relevant for the research at hand. Historical institutionalists use the term *critical junctures* to refer to crucial events which trigger path-dependent processes \citep{Capoccia_2007}. To some extent, they could be likened to black swans or wild cards within futures research.
However, a rigid distinction between critical junctures and path-dependent development may not be appropriate in many cases.

\citet{mahoney2000path} makes the point that critical events are contingent, that is, they cannot be predicted with existing theory.
Thus in order to construct a plausible narrative explanation, the scenario analyst needs to get acquainted with substantive theories on the topic that is studied, what \citet{piirainen2015theory} refer to as using theory within foresight.
The events in the actual historical development of the phenomenon also need to be known.
Narratives are most fruitful when they present mid-level events with a delimited geographical and substantial scope, neither grand master narratives nor simply lists of individual events.

The goal of narrative explanation and analytic narratives is generalisation of sequence types.
If every sequence is entirely unique, they do not provide useful material for scenario building apart from demonstrating the historical context for future paths.
History certainly does not repeat itself, but it is plausible that similar types of processes may occur at different times and in different places, if the conditions are sufficiently similar.
They may even take the form of "robust processes" that occur in similar ways across a wide spectrum of time and place \citep{Aminzade_1992}.
Generalising a sequence means looking at it in more abstract terms, removing contextual features to reveal the essence of the narrative.
Different approaches to generalisation have been proposed by Abell and Heise, for example \citep{Abbott_1992}.
The metaphor of a musical sequence, where a melodic pattern is repeated at different pitches, is apt here.

Clearly the case of the 'right to be forgotten' can be expressed as a narrative with protagonists and key events, but can it be made into an analytic narrative?
For this purpose, the actors would need to be viewed more generally, considering "data controllers" rather than Google and "legislators" rather than the European Parliament.
For a tentative list of general privacy actors, see \citet[][219--220]{bennett2006governance}.
Secondly, one would need to hypothesise about theoretical links between events, in the form of causal mechanisms.
I will turn to this concept next.
