# Causality and mechanisms

The concept of reactive sequences entails that events and actions are linked to each other. What does this mean? In order to understand linkages, the concept of causality needs to be briefly discussed. In positivist social science, causal explanations mean that certain empirically observable features appear together, for instance low educational level is associated with poverty. In the context of event sequences, causality means something slightly different. Causality in this case means that events are linked together by *causal mechanisms*.

There are various definitions of mechanisms but the general idea is usually the same: opening the 'black box' of causal explanation and explaining *how* certain phenomena bring about other phenomena \cite{Hedstr_m_2010}. In reactive sequences, this means having a theoretical explanation for the connections between the nodes in the event sequence. A process or a sequence of events is thus a chain of mechanisms.

Necessary and sufficient conditions (Mahoney)

\citet{Abbott_1992} writes about *enchainment* rather than causality. This means the link in a story from one step to the next.

Mechanism-based explanations make predicting outcomes problematic \cite{Hedstr_m_2010}.
